# Wonde API Exercise

This Laravel application demonstrates use of the Wonde API to satisfy the
following user story:

__As a Teacher I want to be able to see which students are in my class each day
of the week so that I can be suitably prepared__.

## Set up

The local development environment I use is Lando. To run the app using Lando,
you'll need to have some prerequists installed. Please follow
https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.html to install Lando and
dependencies.

Then, to start the app:

```
> lando start
```

Go to https://wonde.lndo.site/ in your browser and you should see the initial
Laravel welcome screen.
